# Large Scale Data Management
Exercises and project for the university course "Large Scale Data Management"

# Practical 1:
## Exercise 1:
Our university would like to define statistics and indicators (KPI) on its level of internationalization. Between all interesting Facts, we focus on "Visiting the University" Fact: doctorands, researchers and professors from other universities spend some time in our university. Use the DFM Schema to model this Fact. The model should be able to let us retrieve statistics on the movement of incoming external personnel and should be able to let us do temporal analysis over their provenance, type of mobility and performed activity, as well as the turor and their information. Storicity: 20 Years.
